This C99 program creates a readable FIFO on /dev/sigh. Anytime a read occurs on this FIFO, a random post from devsigh.com is written to it.

Compile with:
	gcc -o sigh sigh.c -lcurl

Then run it using:
	sudo ./sigh &

From a terminal: type
	cat /dev/sigh
and laugh.

Tested on Linux & iOS

TODO: make this a kernel module. Execve()'ing oneself is not considered an elegant solution.

Enjoy!
